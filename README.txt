# Kitty Chat
A self hosted chat service.

# Motivation
I basically wanted a chat client for my friends and I to talk privatly without it going through a piece of shit company that harvests data and will report shit to the government.

It got worse with the US and UK starting to enforce censorship.

Matrix also doesn't cut it for me as it's a pain in the ass to setup and is highly dependant on having a domain name and a SSL certificate which I personally just wanted to avoid. I wanna be able to setup a private chat service with friends as easily as I would a fucking game server.

So this little project was born!
